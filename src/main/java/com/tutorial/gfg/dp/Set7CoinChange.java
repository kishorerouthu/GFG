 * Created by kishore on 4/5/17.
 *
 * Problem Statement :
 *
 * Given a value N, if we want to make change for N cents,
 * and we have infinite supply of each of S = { S1, S2, .. , Sm} valued coins, how many ways can we make the change?
 * The order of coins doesnâ€™t matter.
 * For example, for N = 4 and S = {1,2,3}, there are four solutions: {1,1,1,1},{1,1,2},{2,2},{1,3}.
 * So output should be 4. For N = 10 and S = {2, 5, 3, 6},
 * there are five solutions: {2,2,2,2,2}, {2,2,3,3}, {2,2,6}, {2,3,5} and {5,5}. So the output should be 5.
 *
 *
 * 1. Optimal substructure
 * To count total number solutions, we can divide all set solutions in two sets.
 *      1. Solutions that do not contain mth coin
 *      2. Solutions that contain at least one mth coin
 *      m - size
 *      n - sum
 *     Let count(s[], m, n) be a function to count the number of solutions, then it can be written as sum
 *     of count(s[], m-1,n) and count(s[],m,n-s[m-1])
